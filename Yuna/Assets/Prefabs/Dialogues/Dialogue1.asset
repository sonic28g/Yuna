    <Text>k__BackingField: "My dear, I don\u2019t wish to upset you but\u2026 your
      father was just taken away by the shogun\u2019s guards. He is being accused
      of the highest of treasons. "
  - <Speaker>k__BackingField: Yuna
    <Text>k__BackingField: Why? What is going on?
  - <Speaker>k__BackingField: 'Chiyo '
    <Text>k__BackingField: "I don\u2019t know how to tell you this, but he was accused
      of trying to overthrow our lord. "
  - <Speaker>k__BackingField: Yuna
    <Text>k__BackingField: "What?! But that can\u2019t be! My father would never
      do something like this! "
  - <Speaker>k__BackingField: 'Chiyo '
    <Text>k__BackingField: 'We both know that, Yuna. But we must be careful, not
      everyone in the palace thinks the same. They think your father is a traitor. '
  - <Speaker>k__BackingField: Yuna
    <Text>k__BackingField: "I can\u2019t just wait here, while my father is in danger.
      [Ama], I will not rest until the real culprit is behind bars and my father
      is back with us again! "
  - <Speaker>k__BackingField: 'Chiyo '
    <Text>k__BackingField: I knew you would say that. And I will not stop you from
      doing whatever you think is right. All these years I have trained you for something
      like this. I think you are ready, dear.
